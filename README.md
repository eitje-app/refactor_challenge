# Eitje refactor challenge

### Introduction

At [eitje](https://www.eitje.app) we care about the quality of our code.

What constitutes <em>good</em> code is something you can argue about for hours. To us it means that code is at least **compact** (more lines means more lines to write, debug and maintain) and **clear** (all code will inevitability be (re)read by others and your future self).

But talking principles is much easier that implementing principles. When we gave our fictitious intern Messy Max a coding challenge, things escalated pretty quickly!

In `messy_max_solution.js` you can find his solution. While the code functions properly (cheers to Max!), it does not qualify as <em>good</em> code. Will you show him how his code may be refactored?

### The challenge

Read the original challenge we gave Messy Max in `CHALLENGE.md` and his solution in `messy_max_solution.js`. You may inspect the results of his code by running `node messy_max_solution.js {any integer value}` in your CLI.

Create a new file `my_solution.js` where you show how Messy Max's code may be improved, while the return value remains the same. ZIP the project folder with your solution included and, optionally, a `REMARKS.md` with an explanation for the choices you made. You may send your solution to jurriaan@eitje.app and abel@eitje.app.
